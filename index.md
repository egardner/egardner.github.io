I work with museums, educational institutions, non-profits, and start-ups as a designer and project manager. From concept to execution, I bring a broad set of skills to projects & creative teams. I hold a BA from UCLA in Design | Media Arts and a certificate of Web and Interaction design from UCLA Extension. I love finding ways to tell compelling stories using typography, illustration, and photography.
<br />

When I'm not designing, I'm going on long bike rides, making small-batch cider, or playing with my dog, Laszlo.
<br />
I currently live and work in Portland, Oregon.
