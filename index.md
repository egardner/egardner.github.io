I work with non-profits, cultural institutions, and artists as a designer and project manager. From concept to execution, I bring a broad set of skills to projects & creative teams. For non-profit organizations I follow the <a href="http://givehalf.co/">Give Half</a> business model where I provide pro-bono design work.

In addition to my work in the field of design, Iâ€™m a passionate maker and educator. I currently live and work in Portland Oregon.
