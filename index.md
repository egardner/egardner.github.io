I work with non-profits, cultural institutions and artists as a designer and project manager. From concept to fabrication, I bring a broad set of skills to projects & creative teams.

Prior to this, I managed the graphics department at Cinnabar CA and worked as an exhibit designer at the J. Paul Getty Museum, where my projects included designing museum exhibits, creating marketing collateral, and installing exhibition graphics.

In addition to my work in the field of environmental design, I’m a passionate maker and educator. I’ve developed an electronics workshops for grade school students, prototyped a cycling jacket with a built-in turn signal, and I participate in L.A.’s growing DIY scene. I’m also passionate about cycling and recently completed a 300 mile bike ride through Northern California to raise awareness about climate change and urban mobility.

I currently live and work in Los Angeles. If you’d like to get in touch, shoot me an email at lebybee[at]gmail.com. Or [download my resume]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/lb_resume_2016.pdf). Work samples available upon request.
