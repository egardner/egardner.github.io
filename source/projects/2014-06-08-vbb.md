In the summer of 2012, while the art world flocked to Venice for the Biennale, Venice Beach held a different sort of art fair. From July 13&ndash;15, local artists took over the famous boardwalk to display their work to thousands of beachgoers &mdash; temporarily erasing any distinction between &quot;high art&quot; and &quot;street art.&quot;

I oversaw the design of this event, working with Hammer curator Ali Subotnick. The &quot;funky pussy&quot; illustration was adapted from artwork created by veteran boardwalk artist Arthure &quot;Art&quot; Moore. Materials included hand-printed silk-screened posters, apparel, giant balloons, and printed ephemera.
