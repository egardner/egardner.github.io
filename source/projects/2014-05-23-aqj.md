A. Quicy Jones: Building for Better Living was the first museum exhibition dedicated to the work of the pioneering mid-century architect.

I designed graphics and branding for this exhibition, working in collaboration with Chu + Gooding Architects. Exhibition materials included brochures, educational materials, a special Family Day event, merchandise, and more.

The project also included an interactive gallery guide, which can be seen [here]({{ site.url }}/aqj-ipad).
