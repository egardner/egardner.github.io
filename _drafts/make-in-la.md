As part of [_Made In L.A. 2014_]({{ site.baseurl }}/made-in-la-2014), the Hammer Museum's education department created a publication and exhibit to help kids and families engage with contemporary art. We settled on the idea of a notebook-style handbook and an architectural-scale map where visitors could share their own stories about specific places in Los Angeles that held meaning for them.
