> “Laurel’s creative flair and critical eye have been fundamental success of the show, and her ideas to make use of fabric - be it real or suggested - as a recurrent motif endowed both the exhibition and its promotional materials with sophistication and seductive elegance.” 
	–Dr. Dave Saunders, Associate Curator at J. Paul Getty Museum

For this groundbreaking special exhibition, I was a part of a lean 2 person design team at the Getty Villa. From initial creative meetings with the curator, we determined a fabric motif would help convey the sumptuous beauty of Aphrodite. We scoured fabric stores in Los Angeles for the perfect cloth. And back at the studio we worked with in-house photographers to set up a photo-shoot. With meticulous determination, we folded the fabric to emulate the poster child’s–The Venus of Capua (Roman, A.D. 117–138)–fabric skirt resting on her hips. 

When we achieved a perfect photograph, we headed back to the drawing board to determine how to tastefully incorporate this texture into the text panels and marketing materials. During this process a request was made to lower the light levels in the window-lined exterior hallway to preserve the marble statues dating back to 330–300 B.C. Our solution was a custom 30 foot long printed fabric scrim that spanned the entire hallway and dampened out most of the natural light. This dark plum colored fabric panel prepared the visitors for an intimate experience with Aphrodite and the Gods of Love. Upon entering the galleries, the visitor would find custom printed fabric scrims hanging nearly floor to ceiling providing a backdrop for the “floating” semi-translucent text panels hovering on stand-offs in front of the fabric scrims.

My roll was to design introductory title wall, street banners, site signage, printed invitations, press packets, web banners, wall text, fabric gallery banners, object labels, museum store products and merchandising. I assisted the lead designer with architectural drawings and assisted during installation.
