> “Laurel’s creative flair and critical eye have been fundamental success of the show, and her ideas to make use of fabric - be it real or suggested - as a recurrent motif endowed both the exhibition and its promotional materials with sophistication and seductive elegance.” –Dr. Dave Saunders, Associate Curator at J. Paul Getty Museum

>	”Laurel always brought ambition, thoughtfulness and a collaborative spirit to our work together on studio projects at the Getty Center and then at the Getty Villa designing the "Aphrodite and the Gods of Love" exhibition together. Her fresh ideas, exploration of creative concepts, and keen interest in 3D design are well rounded by a positive attitude and necessary sense of humor. She will dive into any problem with zeal and creativity. I personally saw Laurel grow tremendously from her start as an intern in our studio to juggling the many demands of comprehensive exhibition design.” –Christina Webb, Designer II, J. Paul Getty Museum 

In 2012, I worked with a small team on the groundbreaking exhibition _Aphrodite and the Gods of Love_. After the initial creative meetings, we decided that a fabric motif would best convey the sumptuous beauty of the goddess. Los Angeles’ famous fabric stores were a great source of inspiration. After some searching, my colleagues and I found the perfect cloth and staged a photo shoot. Our goal was to emulate the look of one of the star sculptures in the exhibition: “The Venus of Capua” sculpture (AD 117-138), which is clothed in a remarkably detailed fabric skirt.

This fabric imagery formed the basis for the visual design of the show. When the curators requested that we lower the light levels in the galleries in order to protect the marble statues, some of which were more than 2,000 years old, our solution was a custom 30 foot long printed fabric scrim that spanned the entire hallway and dampened out most of the natural light. This dark plum colored fabric panel prepared the visitors for an intimate experience with Aphrodite and the Gods of Love. Upon entering the galleries, the visitor would find custom printed fabric scrims hanging nearly floor to ceiling providing a backdrop for the “floating” semi-translucent text panels hovering on stand-offs in front of the fabric scrims.

I worked on all aspects of the exhibition, from the introductory title wall, street banners, and site signage, to printed invitations, press packets, web banners, wall text, fabric gallery banners, object labels, museum store products and merchandising. I also worked with the lead designer on architectural drawings and assisted during installation.
