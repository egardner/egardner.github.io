K.A.M.P. (Kids Art Museum Project) is an event imagined by artists for kids. Painters, sculptors, photographers, and other creative pros led inventive workshops and experiences for kids of all ages in the carefree atmosphere of the Hammer courtyard. All K.A.M.P. proceeds support the Museum's growing Hammer Kids public programming.
