> “Designed to inspire visitors to find their own paths to making a difference in the world, the exhibition will explore four critical humanitarian issues—education, health, jobs, and empowerment—and reveal how organizations, both local and global, are developing workable solutions to these worldwide challenges. ”  
> &mdash; [Skirball Cultural Center Press Release](http://www.skirball.org/about/press/2015/skirball-unveils-details-about-path-appears-actions-for-better-world)

Inspired by the bestselling book _A Path Appears_, by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalists Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, the exhibition was both a gallery installation and a community engagement project—a place where every visitor could take practical, results-driven steps to bring about social change.

Cinnabar worked with C&G partners, wHY Architecture, Skirball Cultural Center, and the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health to fabricate A Path Appears: Actions for a Better World.

As Graphics Manager at Cinnabar, I lead graphics production and installation.
