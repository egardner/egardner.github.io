_Pacific Standard Time: Crosscurrents in L.A. Painting and Sculpture, 1950–1970_
leads viewers on a dynamic tour from the emergence of an indigenous strain of
modernism evident in the hard-edge paintings, assemblage sculpture, and
large-scale ceramics of the 1950s, to the subsequent development of iconic Pop
images of the city in the 1960s, and the conceptual and material contributions
of Light and Space art and process painting that fostered the advanced art of
the 1970s. [getty blog](http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/exhibitions-and-events/crosscurrents/#sthash.T6EXEz7I.dpuf)

I contributed creatively during the initial brainstorming phases of the design
process and assisted proofing and preparing the final graphic files to go out
for print. In addition, I prepared the title wall architectural drawings package
in Vectorworks.
