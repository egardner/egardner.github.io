”Watercolor is regarded as one of the most challenging artistic techniques. Its
liquid nature is capable of extraordinary effects of luminosity, but is often
challenging for an artist to control. This exhibition presents works of the
1700s and 1800s by some of the greatest British masters of the medium, including
Thomas Gainsborough, J.M.W. Turner, and William Blake. It explores their
innovative working methods, and looks at the sketching and study of the period.”

For _Luminous Paper: British Watercolors and Drawings_, I designed the
exhibition title treatment, gallery graphics, way-finding signage, text panels,
and object labels.
