> “Laurel is an extremely thoughtful and creative designer, who rises to challenges with aplomb. She is responsive and takes criticism well; although little is needed since her work is consistently top-notch. I appreciate her enthusiasm for every project, and the sensitivity with which she finds solutions. I enjoy working with her, and would recommend her highly to anyone looking for a designer with a great attitude and skill set.” –Nicole Trudeau, Senior Designer at the J. Paul Getty Museum

Images of the Artist, examines ways in which artists have represented themselves, their fellow artists, their activity, or their surroundings over the past five centuries. 

Because it was a unique subject matter for a drawings exhibition, our small design team pushed the envelope when it came to color. During one creative meeting, we must have carried at least 15 painted foam core “swatches”, 4 ft square in size, into the lofty gallery in order to determine which shades of green could work harmoniously throughout the exhibition. The chosen colors–a light mint green and a fresh olive green–provided a perfect backdrop to the smaller drawings framed with generous margins of eggshell colored matts. 

The serif font with tall ascenders served to reflect the artists’ ego and ambitions in representing themselves and their activities. For the title, a superscript “the” created a swash through the ‘A’ in Artists. This was a nod to conventions of period handwriting and the artists signature.  

My roll on this exhibition was to design a custom logotype, site signage, gallery graphics, and object labels. I also assisted vendors ad the in-house preparations crew during installation.
