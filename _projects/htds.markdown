In October of 2013, High Desert Test Sites transformed Joshua Tree and the surrounging desert into an open-air art museum. The event, which happens every two years, involves dozens of artists from around the world. 

I spent a weekend in the desert helping document the event. Some highlights from the trip can be seen here.
