> Cynthia Lleremas, 10, peered through a telescope to see a model of the Scorpius constellation. Lleremas, a fifth-grader at North Hollywood's Julie Korenstein Elementary School, gave the display a nod of approval. <br><br>"In my opinion, it's incredible how these stars can make a form," she said. "It's like an ability to entertain us. When there's nothing to do, I look up at the constellations." <br><br>Lleremas loves the stars, she said. At night, she always tries to find the stars that form Orion's Belt and the Little Dipper. Before running off to join her classmates, Lleremas gave the new museum her review: "It's awesome."<br><br>
