> “Cynthia Lleremas, 10, peered through a telescope to see a model of the Scorpius constellation. Lleremas, a fifth-grader at North Hollywood’s Julie Korenstein Elementary School, gave the display a nod of approval. Before running off to join her classmates, Lleremas gave the  new museum her review: “It’s awesome.” –Los Angeles Times [San Fernando Valley’s Discovery Cube L.A. opens in once-vacant museum](http://www.latimes.com/local/	california/la-me-1114-valley-museum-20141114-story.html “link to article”)

For _Making the Grade_ I worked in tandem with Cinnabar’s in-house Technical Designers and Interactive Developer to create a suite of modular exhibits catering to 4th-6th graders. These interactive STEM exhibits included a wave form table, a sound tube, an interactive molecules game, a constellations viewer and more. All exhibits were designed to move between the Los Angeles and Orange County Discovery Cube locations.

I was the lead designer for _Making the Grade_ and designed all didactic graphic panels, instructional labels, artifact labels, environmental way-finding, and entrance signage. In addition, I managed the production schedule and graphics budget and assisted with concept development and materials research. All graphic panels and instructions were typeset to accommodate both English and Spanish. Working with multiple vendors we produced all graphics through local vendors in Los Angeles.
