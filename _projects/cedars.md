This exhibit celebrates Cedars-Sinai’s rich history and community involvement
with a large format video, interactive media kiosk and dynamic graphic layers
including wall vinyl, window graphics, direct printing on aluminum, angled
surface panels and silkscreened lettering on laminated columns.

While a designer at Cinnabar California, I managed graphic production and
installation for this exhibit. This role included communicating with our
in-house technical design team while overseeing multiple print vendors to
successfully produce and install the exhibit within a very tight timeline.
