> The exhibit celebrates Cedars-Sinai’s rich history and community involvement with a large format video, interactive media kiosk and dynamic graphic layers including wall vinyl, window graphics, direct printing on aluminum, angled surface panels and silkscreened lettering on laminated columns. Cinnabar also worked directly with the staff’s archivist and art council to integrate and mount artifacts into a series of wall mounted vitrines.

As a designer at Cinnabar California, I communicated with our in-house technical design team and coordinated graphic production. This required overseeing multiple print vendors to successfully produce and install the exhibit under a very tight timeline.
