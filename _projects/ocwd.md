The Orange County Water District (OCWD), an internationally recognized leader in the water industry, asked Cinnabar to design and build an interactive exhibit at their headquarters in Fountain Valley, CA. The goal of the exhibit is to educate visitors about OCWD’s mission, projects and goals for the future. The hands-on interactive elements guides the visitor through the world’s largest wastewater purification system.

As a designer at Cinnabar, I helped to create the initial comps and renderings for the exhibit design. Working with the in-house interactive developers and a subcontracted design team I managed the project through production and installation.
