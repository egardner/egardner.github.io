_Obsidian Mirror Travels: Refracting Ancient Mexican Art and Antiquity_ explores
representations of Mexican archaeological objects and sites made from the
Colonial era to the present.

I was the lead designer for this exhibit and designed the title wall, logo/brand
for the exhibition, way-finding signage, printed invitations, press packets,
gallery brochure, wall text, object labels and website banners. Both the gallery
and brochure text were typeset to accommodate English and Spanish. I assisted
with the technical design and created full-size case mockups for a variable
number of exhibition artifacts. In addition I oversaw installation through to
completion.
