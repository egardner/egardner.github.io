<!-- I designed this fun interactive welcome gift for a prestigious non-profit school. I created a suite of custom illustrations, inspired by well-known areas of the school. This little pocket-sized coloring book was produced by a local printer. We used an opaque white ink on a craft paper cover.

My role: art direction, custom illustration, book design, print production -->
