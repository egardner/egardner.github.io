Hello world.
I'm Eric Gardner, a graphic designer and developer living in Los Angeles. I'm
interested in the places where art, technology, and politics intersect.

Currently I work for the Getty Museum as Digital Publications Developer, working
to imagine the future of art books. Previously I was the the Senior Designer at
the Hammer Museum.

My other interests include analog and digital photography, bicycling, writing
code, and social justice. All the photos that appear on the front page of this
site are my own work, and were taken around LA and the Southern California desert.

If you're interested in seeing more of my photography, you can find my Flickr
page [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/eric-gardner/), and my Instagram
account [here](https://instagram.com/ec_gardner/).

This site was hand-built using Jekyll, the CMS-free static site generator, and
is still under active development.
