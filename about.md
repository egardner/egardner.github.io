Currently I’m the Senior Exhibition Designer at Cinnabar California, where I help museums and cultural institutions translate their ideas into built environments. From curation to fabrication, I bring a broad set of design skills to bear on clients’ challenges.

Prior to this, I worked as a designer at the J. Paul Getty Museum, where my projects included designing museum exhibits, creating marketing collateral, and installing graphics.

In addition to my work in the field of environmental design, I’m a passionate maker and educator. I’ve developed an electronics workshops for grade school students, prototyped a cycling jacket with a built-in turn signal, and I participate in L.A.’s growing DIY scene. I’m also passionate about cycling and recently completed a 300 mile bike ride through Northern California to raise awareness about climate change and urban mobility. 

I graduated with honors from UCLA’s Design | Media Arts program. Upon graduation I went to New York to complete a design internship at Ed Lab, a research, design, and development unit at Teachers College, Columbia University. That same year, I presented at the Intel Developer Forum and was awarded for “Most Innovative Design.”  I went on to complete an internship at a boutique lighting design studio in Melbourne, Australia. 

I currently live and work in Los Angeles. If you’d like to get in touch, shoot me an email at lebybee@gmail.com.
